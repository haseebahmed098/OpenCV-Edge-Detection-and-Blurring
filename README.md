# OpenCV-Edge-Detection-and-Blurring
working on blurring and edges detection of images
Edge detection is an image-processing technique that is used to identify the boundaries (edges) of objects or regions within an image. Edges are among the most important features associated with images. We know the underlying structure of an image through its edges. Computer vision processing pipelines, therefore, extensively use edge detection in applications.

How are Edges Detected?
Sobel Edge Detection
Canny Edge Detection
Summary

How are Edges Detected?
Sudden changes in pixel intensity characterize edges. We need to look for such changes in the neighboring pixels to detect edges. Letâ€™s explore using two important edge-detection algorithms available in OpenCV: Sobel Edge Detection and Canny Edge Detection. We will discuss the theory as well as demonstrate the use of each in OpenCV.

First, take a look at the code that will demonstrate edge detection. Each line of code will be discussed in detail so that you understand it fully.
